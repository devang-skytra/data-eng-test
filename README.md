# README #

This is a repository to store misc scripts from simple bash utils up to cluster deployment scripts.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* This repository is intended for those involved in Automation - Data Engineers and DevOps
* It does not require code approval - it is to reliably store sample scripts from appropriate blogs, and scripts while under development 
+ Any code that evolves and is to be productionalised should be copied to a team repository requiring approvals (and marked as deactivated in this repository)
